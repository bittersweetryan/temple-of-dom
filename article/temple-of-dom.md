#Reading The Map
Our terrain isn't made up of mountains, rivers, and valleys, however it does have a tree.  In this instance, its not a tree you find in a forrest, its a digital tree comprised of nodes.  Each HTML page is comprised of one or more nodes.

#The Treasure Hunt
Using only the native JavaScript objects that are in the DOM (and a little bit of household cleaner known as AJAX)we'll dive into the depths of twitter to search for hidden treasure. Using a basic HTML document as our map we'll use  traverse the DOM tree, add/edit/remove elements on the page, listen for events, and even get some data using the browser's XMLHttpRequest object.
